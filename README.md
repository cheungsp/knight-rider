This is the API back end of Knight Rider, used to store and query from all crimes, red light cameras and accident hot spots.
Data is stored and parsed from CSV files. Crime data is made available from City of Vancouver, and the red light camera positions were made available from ICBC. See Knight-Rider-SPA for working project demo.
